# Who is Jennifer Yu

## Programmer
- I'm currently working as an online instructor for Code Central Las Vegas. We teach students K-12 in various topics of computer science like Scratch, Python coding, Arduino, web development, game development, and more. You can learn more about us [here](https://mycodecentral.com/)!
<br><br>
- Last summer I had the opportunity to work as a STEP intern at Google. I was a part of the Assistant Team working on Google TV. I learned C++ for my project and was able to gain experience working in the industry.
<br><br>
- My favorite programming language is Java, but I have experience with some other ones as well. Nothing beats typing `System.out.println();` over and over again though.

- **Books!** Currently reading Stephen King's *The Dark Tower* series. The first book's ending made me feel a little existential.

- **Cooking and baking!** I bake cookies or bread whenever I'm stressed and meal prep when I'm bored.
